Introduction
============

This module contains some jQuery_ `browser resources`_ for Zope_. It was
originally developed for GroupServer_ (hence the ``gs.``
name-space). However, it is completely devoid of anything that is specific
to GroupServer: any Zope or Plone_ project should be able to make use of
this egg.

Browser Resources
=================

Two browser resources are defined.

``/++resource++jquery-1.9.1.js``:
  The core jQuery code.


``/++resource++jquery-1.9.1.min.js``:
  The minified version of the jQuery code.
