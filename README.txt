Introduction
============

This module contains some jQuery_ and `jQuery.UI`_ `browser resources`_ for
Zope_. It was originally developed for GroupServer_ (hence the ``gs.``
name-space). However, it is completely devoid of anything that is specific
to GroupServer: any Zope or Plone_ project should be able to make use of
this egg.

Browser Resources
=================

Three browser resources are defined.

``/++resource++jquery-1.8.3.js``:
  The core jQuery code.

``/++resource++jquery-ui-1.9.2.custom.min.js``:
  The jQuery.UI code.

``/++resource++jquery-ui-1.9.2-css/``:
  The directory-resource that contains all the CSS and related images.
